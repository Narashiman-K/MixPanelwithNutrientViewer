# Nutrient PDF Viewer with Mixpanel event tracker Example (Vite + React)

This project demonstrates how to integrate the [Nutrient (PSPDFKit) Web SDK](https://www.nutrient.io/sdk/web/) with MixPanel to include advanced event tracking with [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/) and a built-in debug panel for real-time analytics.

---

## Features

- üìÑ **View and Annotate PDFs** using the Nutrient (PSPDFKit) Web SDK.
- üìù **Track User Interactions** (annotations, navigation, zoom, search, etc.) with Mixpanel.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Debug Panel** for live inspection of SDK events and analytics.
- ‚ö° **Fast Development** with Vite and React 18.
- üîí **Environment-based configuration** for API keys and tokens.

---

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or newer recommended)
- A valid Nutrient (PSPDFKit) Web SDK license key
- A Mixpanel project token

---

## Getting Started

```

### 2. Install Dependencies

  app.jsx                # Main React app
  components/
    pdf-viewer-component.jsx  # Nutrient SDK integration & event tracking
    debug-panel.jsx           # Live Mixpanel/SDK event debug panel
  services/
    mixpanel.js               # Mixpanel analytics integration
public/

.env                     # Environment variables (license keys, tokens)
```

## Analytics & Debugging

- All major SDK events (page navigation, annotation, search, etc.) are tracked via [`mixpanelService`](src/services/mixpanel.js).
- The [`DebugPanel`](src/components/debug-panel.jsx) shows live event stats and recent events for development and troubleshooting.
- You can trigger test events and clear the event log from the debug panel.

---

## Customization

- **Toolbar**: Modify the `toolbarItems` array in [`pdf-viewer-component.jsx`](src/components/pdf-viewer-component.jsx) to customize available tools.
- **Mixpanel Events**: Extend or adjust event tracking in [`setupNutrientSDKEvents`](src/components/pdf-viewer-component.jsx) and [`mixpanelService`](src/services/mixpanel.js).
- **Styling**: Edit `app.css` or add your own styles for UI customization.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Nutrient SDK not loading?**  
  Ensure your license key is valid and available in `.env` as `VITE_lkey`.
- **Mixpanel not tracking?**  
  Check your Mixpanel token in `.env` and browser console for debug logs.
- **PDF not displaying?**  
  Confirm the PDF file is valid and CORS is not blocking access.
